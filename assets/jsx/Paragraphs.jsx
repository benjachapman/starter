            <p>The vast majority of the NFL’s 32 teams have made it through four games, which means it’s time to begin one of my favorite annual recurring features. It’s fun to hand out awards during each quarter of the NFL season, but it also produces some perspective as we get lost during the 17-week season. This time last year, we hadn’t even seen Odell Beckham Jr. play, and Aaron Donald was playing only a handful of St. Louis’s snaps. Kelvin Benjamin and Kyle Fuller, respectively, were the Offensive and Defensive Rookies of the Year. Philip Rivers was the leading MVP candidate, with Aaron Rodgers putting up great numbers for a 3-2 Packers team.</p>
            <p>Things change, but I’m not bringing those players up to point out how they were obviously usurped. Their performances in the first quarter of the season weren’t any less great, but we forgot about them because other players emerged. Benjamin can’t build on his 2014 while he’s out with a torn ACL, obviously, while Fuller has been one of the few bright spots in a struggling Bears defense. Rivers, who faded badly as the season went along, leads the league in passing yards behind a decaying offensive line and may make a run at completing 70 percent of his attempts. Rodgers and the Packers, on the other hand … they’re not 3-2 this time around.</p>
